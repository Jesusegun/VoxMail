# âœ… Fly.io GitHub Workflow Disabled

## What Was Done

Deleted `.github/workflows/fly-deploy.yml` to stop automatic Fly.io deployment attempts on every `git push` to the `main` branch.

## Why This Was Necessary

Since we migrated from Fly.io to DigitalOcean VPS, the GitHub Actions workflow was still trying to deploy to Fly.io on every push, causing "Run failed: Fly Deploy" email notifications.

## What Happens Now

- âœ… No more Fly.io deployment failure emails
- âœ… GitHub Actions won't trigger on push
- âœ… Your VPS deployment is manual and controlled

## Next Steps: Deploy to VPS

To deploy your latest changes (including admin authentication) to the VPS:

```powershell
# On your local machine
git add .
git commit -m "Remove Fly.io workflow and add admin authentication"
git push origin main
```

```bash
# On your VPS
ssh root@46.101.177.154
cd /root/VoxMail

# Update .env with admin credentials
nano .env
# Add:
# ADMIN_USERNAME=ben
# ADMIN_PASSWORD=Taiwoben123$
# Save: Ctrl+X, Y, Enter

# Pull and deploy
git pull origin main
docker build -t voxmail:latest .
docker stop voxmail && docker rm voxmail
docker run -d --name voxmail -p 8080:8080 \
  -v /root/VoxMail/data:/app/data \
  -v /root/VoxMail/ai_data:/app/ai_data \
  -v /root/VoxMail/credentials:/app/credentials \
  --env-file .env --restart unless-stopped voxmail:latest
```

## Verification

After deployment, test:
- Navigate to: http://46.101.177.154:8080
- You should see the admin login page
- No more Fly.io emails!

**Status:** Fly.io workflow removed. Ready to deploy to VPS! ðŸš€
